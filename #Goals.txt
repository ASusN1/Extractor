# VIDEO DOWNLOADER PROJECT - GOALS & ROADMAP

## CORE FUNCTIONALITY
- [✓] Download videos from various sources (YouTube, Instagram)
- [✓] Use yt_dlp library for video downloading
- [✓] Support multiple download formats: audio only, video only, video with audio
- [✓] Allow users to select video resolution/quality
- [✓] Custom save path selection

## COMPLETED FEATURES
- [✓] Download URL functionality working
- [✓] Browse and enter path option working
- [✓] Download with user-specified save path

## RESOLVED ISSUES
- Fixed path error by using raw strings (r"path") to prevent backslash escape issues
- Resolved duplicate filename issue: Files now named as "(video_name) + (type) + (quality)"
  Example: "MyVideo_video_with_audio_1080p.mp4"

## UI REQUIREMENTS (Tkinter)
- Window dimensions: 600x800
- Scalable interface (elements resize proportionally)
- Color scheme: Dark blue theme with white text
- Font: TBD

## FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT

### 1. Quality Selection
- When URL is fetched, display available qualities (144p, 240p, 720p, 1080p, etc.)
- Show options in a dropdown/listbox
- Default to best available quality if user doesn't select

### 2. File Size Display
- Show estimated file size before download (500MB, 1.3GB, etc.)
- Update size based on selected format (audio/video/both)

### 3. Download Progress Bar
- Blue: downloading in progress
- Green: download complete
- Red: error occurred

### 4. Video Preview (STRETCH GOAL - LOWEST PRIORITY)
- Display short preview of video before downloading
- This is the most challenging feature
